# Bayesian statistics & MCMC {#crashcourse}

## Introduction

In this first chapter, you will learn what the Bayesian theory is, and how you may use it in a simple example. You will also see how to implement simulation algorithms to implement the Bayesian method for more complex analyses. This is not an exhaustive treatment of Bayesian statistics, but you should get what you need to navigate through the rest of the book. 

## Bayes' theorem

**Ajouter quelque chose sur la démarche scientifique?**

Bayesian statistics relies on the Bayes' theorem. **Something about Reverend Bayes, not as boring as usual stuff**. This theorem or formula if you prefer **look for difference btw theorem and formula** is all about conditional probabilities. **What are conditional probabilities? Link towards nice videos**. It states that for events $A$ and $B$, we have:
$$\Pr(B \mid A) = \displaystyle{\frac{ \Pr(A \mid B) \; \Pr(B)}{\Pr(A)}}$$

```

I don't know about you, but I have a hard time not messing the letters around. It is easier to remember Bayes' theorem written like this:

$$ \Pr(\text{hypothesis} \mid \text{data}) = \frac{ \Pr(\text{data} \mid \text{hypothesis}) \; \Pr(\text{hypothesis})}{\Pr(\text{data})} $$
The *hypothesis* is what you want to learn about using the data. For capture-recapture models, the *hypothesis* is a parameter like detection probability, or the regression parameters of the relationship between survival probability and some covariates. **Citer Taj Mahr comme source**. Bayes theorem tells you the probability of the hypothesis given the data. This is great because what is doing science after all? We'd like to know how plausible is some hypothesis given the data? **dire des trucs sur les termes de droite!** In that respect, the Bayesian reasoning echoes the scientific reasoning. You might ask then, why is Bayesian statistics not the default in statistics? Clearly, until recently, there were practical problems to implement the Bayesian approach. Recent advances in computational power coupled with the development of new methodology have led to a great increase in the application of Bayesian methods within the last three decades. Also, because of futile wars between (male) statisticians, little progress was made for over two centuries. $$en dire un peu plus sur ces guerres$$.

## Frequentist versus Bayesian	

Typical statistical problems involve estimating parameter(s) $\theta$ with available data. To do so, you might be more used to the frequentist rather than the Bayesian method. The frequentist approach, and in particulat maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) assumes that the parameters are fixed, and have unknown values to be estimated. Therefore classical estimates are generally point estimates of the parameters of interest. In contrast, the Bayesian approach assumes that the parameters are not fixed but have some fixed  unknown distribution -- a distribution for the parameter. **qu'entend-on par distribution?**

## What is the Bayesian approach?	

The approach is based upon the idea that you, the experimenter, begin with some prior beliefs about the system. In other words, you never start from scratch. And then you update these beliefs on the basis of observed data. This updating procedure is based upon the Bayes' theorem which we've seen earlier: 

$$\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(B \mid A) \; \Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)}$$
Loosely, let's say $A = \theta$ and $B = \text{data}$, then the Bayes' theorem translates into:

$$\Pr(\theta \mid \text{data}) = \frac{\Pr(\text{data} \mid \theta) \; \Pr(\theta)}{\Pr(\text{data})}$$
or with some colors: 

$${\color{red}{\Pr(\theta \mid \text{data})}} = \frac{\color{blue}{\Pr(\text{data} \mid \theta)} \; \color{green}{\Pr(\theta)}}{\color{orange}{\Pr(\text{data})}}.$$

Let's spend some time going through each quantity.  

$\color{red}{\text{Posterior distribution}}$: It represents what you know after having seen the data. This is the basis for inference, a distribution, possibly multivariate if you have more than one parameter. 

$\color{blue}{\text{Likelihood}}$: This quantity is the same as in the MLE approach. **Faut-il en dire plus ici sur MLE? En tous cas détailler la vraisemblance**

$\color{green}{\text{Prior distribution}}$: This quantity represents what you know before seeing the data. This is the source of much discussion about the Bayesian approach. **dire qu'on y revient quelque part?**

$\color{orange}{\Pr(\text{data}) = \int{L(\text{data} \mid \theta)\Pr(\theta) d\theta}}$ is a $N$-dimensional integral if $\theta = \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_N$. This quantity is difficult if not impossible to calculate. This is one of the reasons why the Bayesian method wasn't used until recently. And this is the reason why we need simulation algorithms to get the posteriors. Let's get to it. **Manque un exemple ou on peut calculer le posterior sans MCMC, introduire conjugaison, et peut-être MLE?**

## Brute force via numerical integration

Let's take an example. Say we release $n$ animals at the beginning of a winter, out of which $y$ survive, and we'd like to estimate winter survival $\theta$. **Renvoyer au bouquin avec Ruth pour cet example**
```{r}
y <- 19 # nb of success
n <- 57 # nb of attempts
```

**Préciser quelque part qu'on prend formalisme McElreath pour présenter les modèles**. Our model **détailler un peu vraisemblance et prior**:
  
  \begin{align*}
y &\sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta) &\text{[likelihood]}
\\
\theta &\sim \text{Beta}(1, 1) &\text{[prior for }\theta \text{]} \\ 
\end{align*}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
a <- 1; b <- 1; p <- seq(0,1,.002); prior <- dbeta(p,a,b)
dfprior <- data.frame(p = p, prior = prior) 
dfprior %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = p, y = prior), 
            size = 1.5,
            color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[1])
#plot(p, dbeta(p,a,b), type='l', lwd=3)
```

Now we apply Bayes theorem. We write a function that computes the product of the likelihood times the prior: $\Pr(\text{data} \mid \theta) \; \Pr(\theta)$
```{r}
numerator <- function(p) dbinom(y,n,p) * dbeta(p,a,b)
```

We write another function that calculates the denominator, averaged likelihood: $\Pr(\text{data}) = \int{L(\theta \mid \text{data}) \; \Pr(\theta) d\theta}$
```{r}
denominator <- integrate(numerator,0,1)$value
```

Then we get the posterior via numerical integration. **faire afficher le bout de code qui suit?**
```{r, echo = FALSE}
numerical_posterior <- data.frame(p = p, posterior = numerator(p)/denominator) 
numerical_posterior %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = p, y = posterior), 
            size = 1.5, 
            col = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[2], 
            alpha = 0.5)
```

We may superimpose the explicit posterior to check how well our numerical approximation did. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
explicit_posterior <- dbeta(p, y + a, n - y + b)
dfexpposterior <- data.frame(p = p, explicit_posterior = explicit_posterior)
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = numerical_posterior, 
            aes(x = p, y = posterior), 
            size = 1.5, 
            col = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[2],
            alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(data = dfexpposterior, 
            aes(x = p, y = explicit_posterior),
            size = 1.5, 
            col = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[3], 
            linetype = "dashed")
```

To finish up, let's add the prior. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = numerical_posterior, 
            aes(x = p, y = posterior), 
            size = 1.5, 
            col = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[2], 
            alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(data = dfexpposterior, 
            aes(x = p, y = explicit_posterior),
            col = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[3], 
            size = 1.5, 
            linetype = "dashed") + 
  geom_line(data = dfprior,
            aes(x = p, y = prior),
            col = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Royal1[1],
            size = 1.5)
```

Now what if you had multiple parameters? For example, you'd like to fit a capture-recapture model with parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $p$ that need to be estimated. **expliquer** Bayes' theorem says:

$$ P(\alpha, \beta, p \mid \text{data}) = \frac{ P(\text{data} \mid \alpha, \beta, p) \, P(\alpha, \beta, p)}{\iiint \, P(\text{data} \mid \alpha, \beta, p) \, P(\alpha, \beta, p) \,d\alpha \,d\beta \,dp} $$
Do we really wish to calculate a 3D integral? The answer is no obviously. **Transition**

## Bayesian computation with MCMC

In the early 1990s, statisticians rediscovered work from the 1950's in physics.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Article cover. Source: JSTOR"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/metropolis.png")
```

The authors used simulations to draw samples from posterior distributions of the parameters of interest. This is a neat trick to avoid explicit calculation of the integrals in Bayes formula. **formula ou theorem?** Instead, we aim at approximating posterior with some precision by drawing large samples. These simulation algorithms are called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and they definitely gave a boost to Bayesian statistics. **simulation algorithm ou stochastic algorithms. Expliquer.**

Why are MCMC methods so useful? Well to understand why, weed to better explain the what. MCMC are stochastic algorithms to produce sequence of dependent random numbers from a Markov chain. What is a Markov chain? A Markov chain is a discrete sequence of states, in which the probability of an event depends only on the state in the previous event. **donner example de la météo?** By construction, a Markov chain has an equilibrium (aka stationary) distribution. **expliquer** The cool thing is that the equilibrium distribution is the desired posterior distribution. **why is it so cool? plutôt que de simuler comme des dingues, il suffit de tirer dans Markov chain, et eventuellement, on converge vers distribution statitionnaire qui est l'a posteriori!**

There are several ways of constructing these chains: e.g., Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampler. Here I will illustrate the Metropolis algorithm and how to implement it in practice.

Let's go back to animal survival estimation. We illustrate sampling from the posterior distribution. We write functions in `R` for the likelihood, the prior and the posterior.

```{r}
# survival data, 19 "success" out of 57 "attempts"
survived <- 19
released <- 57

# log-likelihood function
loglikelihood <- function(x, p){
  dbinom(x = x, size = released, prob = p, log = TRUE)
}

# prior density
logprior <- function(p){
  dunif(x = p, min = 0, max = 1, log = TRUE)
}

# posterior density function (log scale)
posterior <- function(x, p){
  loglikelihood(x, p) + logprior(p) # - log(Pr(data))
}
```

The Metropolis algorithm works as follows: 
  
1. We start at any possible value of the parameter to be estimated. 

2. To decide where to visit next, we propose to move away from the current value of the parameter <span>&#8212;</span> this is a **candidate** value. To do so, we add to the current value some random value from say a normal distribution with some variance.
  
3. We compute the ratio of the probabilities at the candidate and current locations $R = \text{posterior(candidate)/posterior(current)}$. This is where the magic of MCMC happens, in that $\Pr(\text{data})$, the denominator of the Bayes theorem, cancels out. 

4. We spin a continuous spinner that lands anywhere from 0 to 1 -- call it the random spin $X$. If $X$ is smaller than $R$, we move to the candidate location, otherwise we remain at the current location.
  
5. We repeat 2-4 a number of times -- or **steps** (many steps).
  
```{r}
# propose candidate value
move <- function(x, away = .2){ 
  logitx <- log(x / (1 - x))
  logit_candidate <- logitx + rnorm(1, 0, away)
  candidate <- plogis(logit_candidate)
  return(candidate)
}

# set up the scene
steps <- 100
theta.post <- rep(NA, steps)
set.seed(1234)

# pick starting value (step 1)
inits <- 0.5
theta.post[1] <- inits
```

```{r}
for (t in 2:steps){ # repeat steps 2-4 (step 5)
  
  # propose candidate value for prob of success (step 2)
  theta_star <- move(theta.post[t-1])
  
  # calculate ratio R (step 3)
  pstar <- posterior(survived, p = theta_star)  
  pprev <- posterior(survived, p = theta.post[t-1])
  logR <- pstar - pprev
  R <- exp(logR)
  
  # decide to accept candidate value or to keep current value (step 4)
  accept <- rbinom(1, 1, prob = min(R, 1))
  theta.post[t] <- ifelse(accept == 1, theta_star, theta.post[t-1])
}
```

Starting at the value $0.5$ and running the algorithm for $100$ iterations.

```{r}
head(theta.post)
tail(theta.post)
```

Let's run a single chain.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:steps, y = theta.post)
df %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), size = 1.5, color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Zissou1[1]) + 
  labs(x = "iterations", y = "values from posterior distribution") + 
  ylim(0.1, 0.6)
```

What about another chain?
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}

# pick starting value (step 1)
inits <- 0.2
theta.post2 <- rep(NA, steps)
theta.post2[1] <- inits

for (t in 2:steps){ # repeat steps 2-4 (step 5)
  # propose candidate value for prob of success (step 2)
  theta_star <- move(theta.post2[t-1])
  # calculate ratio R (step 3)
  pstar <- posterior(survived, p = theta_star)  
  pprev <- posterior(survived, p = theta.post[t-1])
  logR <- pstar - pprev
  R <- exp(logR)
  
  # decide to accept candidate value or to keep current value (step 4)
  accept <- rbinom(1, 1, prob = min(R, 1))
  theta.post2[t] <- ifelse(accept == 1, theta_star, theta.post2[t-1])
}

df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:steps, y = theta.post2)
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y), size = 1.5, color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Zissou1[1]) + 
  geom_line(data = df2, aes(x = x, y = y), size = 1.5, color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Zissou1[3]) + 
  labs(x = "iterations", y = "values from posterior distribution") + 
  ylim(0.1, 0.6)
```

Notice that we didn't get the same exact results. **Stochasticity.** Now let's increase the number of steps and go with 5000 iterations.
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# set up the scene
steps <- 5000
theta.post <- rep(NA, steps)
set.seed(1234)

# pick starting value (step 1)
inits <- 0.5
theta.post[1] <- inits

for (t in 2:steps){ # repeat steps 2-4 (step 5)
  
  # propose candidate value for prob of success (step 2)
  theta_star <- move(theta.post[t-1])
  
  # calculate ratio R (step 3)
  pstar <- posterior(survived, p = theta_star)  
  pprev <- posterior(survived, p = theta.post[t-1])
  logR <- pstar - pprev
  R <- exp(logR)
  
  # decide to accept candidate value or to keep current value (step 4)
  accept <- rbinom(1, 1, prob = min(R, 1))
  theta.post[t] <- ifelse(accept == 1, theta_star, theta.post[t-1])
}

df <- data.frame(x = 1:steps, y = theta.post)
df %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), size = 1, color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Zissou1[1]) + 
  labs(x = "iterations", y = "values from posterior distribution") + 
  ylim(0.1, 0.6) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(theta.post)), 
             color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Zissou1[3],
             size = 1.2) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 19/57), 
             color = wesanderson::wes_palettes$Zissou1[5],
             size = 1.2)
```

## Assessing convergence
  
+ MCMC algorithms can be used to construct a Markov chain with a given stationary distribution (set to be the posterior distribution).

+ For the MCMC algorithm, the posterior distribution is only needed to be known up to proportionality. 

+ Once the stationary distribution is reached, we can regard the realisations of the chain as a (dependent) sample from the posterior distribution (and obtain Monte Carlo estimates).

+ We consider some important implementation issues.

+ The movement around the parameter space is often referred to as **mixing**.

+ Traceplots of for small and big moves provide (relatively) high correlations (known as autocorrelations) between successive observations of the Markov chain.

+ Strongly correlated observations require large sample sizes and therefore longer simulations.

+ Autocorrelation function (ACF) plots are a convenient way of displaying the strength of autocorrelation in the given sample values.

+ ACF plots provide the autocorrelation between successively sampled values separated by $k$ iterations, referred to as lag, (i.e. $\text{cor}(\theta_t, \theta_{t+k})$) for increasing values of $k$.

## How do good chains behave? 
  
+ Converge to same target distribution; discard some realisations of Markov chain before convergence is achieved.

+ Once there, explore efficiently: The post-convergence sample size required for suitable numerical summaries.

+ Therefore, we are looking to determine how long it takes for the Markov chain to converge to the stationary distribution.

+ In practice, we must discard observations from the start of the chain and just use observations from the chain once it has converged.

+ The initial observations that we discard are referred to as the **burn-in**.

+ Simplest method to determine length of burn-in period is to look at trace plots.

## Burn-in

set.seed(1234)

# pick starting value (step 1)
inits <- 0.99
theta.post[1] <- inits

for (t in 2:steps){ # repeat steps 2-4 (step 5)
  
  # propose candidate value for prob of success (step 2)
  theta_star <- move(theta.post[t-1], away = 0.1)
  
  # calculate ratio R (step 3)

  pprev <- posterior(survived, p = theta.post[t-1])
  logR <- pstar - pprev
  R <- exp(logR)
  
  # decide to accept candidate value or to keep current value (step 4)
  accept <- rbinom(1, 1, prob = min(R, 1))
  theta.post[t] <- ifelse(accept == 1, theta_star, theta.post[t-1])
}

df <- data.frame(x = 1:steps, y = theta.post)

           ymax = 1, 
           alpha = .3) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))
```

If simulations cheap, be conservative.

## Effective sample size `n.eff`
  
* How long of a chain is needed to produce stable estimates ?
* Most MCMC chains are strongly autocorrelated.
* Successive steps are near each other, and are not independent. 
* The effective sample size (`n.eff`) measures chain length while taking into account the autocorrelation of the chain.
* `n.eff` is less than the number of MCMC iterations.
* Check the `n.eff` of every parameter of interest.
* Check the `n.eff` of any interesting parameter combinations.
* We need $\text{n.eff} \geq 100$ independent steps. 

## Potential scale reduction factor
  
+ Gelman-Rubin statistic $\hat{R}$
+ Measures the ratio of the total variability combining multiple chains (between-chain plus within-chain) to the within-chain variability. 
+ Asks the question is there a chain effect? Very much alike the $F$ test in an ANOVA. 
+ Values near $1$ indicates likely convergence, a value of $\leq 1.1$ is considered acceptable.
+ Necessary condition, not sufficient; In other words, these diagnostics cannot tell you that you have converged for sure, only that you have not. 

## To sum up
  
+ Run multiple chains from arbitrary starting places (initial values).
+ Assume convergence when all chains reach same regime
+ Discard initial burn-in phase.
+ Proceed with posterior inference. 
+ Use traceplot, effective sample size and $\hat{R}$.

## What if you have issues of convergence?
  
+ Increase burn-in, sample more.
+	Use more informative priors.
+ Pick better initial values (good guess), using e.g. estimates from simpler models.
+ Reparameterize: 
+ Standardize covariates.
+ Non-centering: $\alpha \sim N(0,\sigma)$ becomes $\alpha = z \sigma$ with $z \sim N(0,1)$.
+	Something wrong with your model? 
+ Start with a simpler model (remove complexities). 
+ Use simulations. 
+ Change your sampler. More later on.
