# NIMBLE tutorial {#intronimble}

## Introduction

In this second chapter, you will get familiar with NIMBLE, an R package that implements up-to-date MCMC algorithms for fitting complex models. NIMBLE spares you from coding the MCMC algorithms by hand, and requires only the specification of a likelihood and priors for model parameters. We will illustrate NIMBLE main features with a simple example, but the ideas hold for other problems.  

## What is NIMBLE?

NIMBLE stands for **N**umerical **I**nference for statistical **M**odels using **B**ayesian and **L**ikelihood **E**stimation. Briefly speaking, NIMBLE is an R package that implements for you MCMC algorithms to generate samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters. Freed from the burden of coding your own MCMC algorithms, you only have to specify a likelihood and priors to apply the Bayes theorem. To do so, NIMBLE uses a syntax very similar to the R syntax, which should make your life easier. This so-called BUGS language is also used by other programs like WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, and JAGS. 

So why use NIMBLE you may ask? The short answer is that NIMBLE is capable of so much more! First, you will work from within R, but in the background NIMBLE will translate your code in C++ for (in general) faster computation. Second, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language for writing new functions and statistical distributions of your own, or borrow those written by others. Third, NIMBLE gives you full control of the MCMC samplers, and you may pick other algorithms than the defaults. Fourth, NIMBLE comes with a library of numerical methods other than MCMC algorithms, including sequential Monte Carlo (for particle filtering) and Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (for maximum likelihood). Last but not least, the development team is friendly and helpful, and based on users' feedbacks, NIMBLE folks work constantly at improving the package capabilities. 

## Running NIMBLE

To run NIMBLE, you will need to specify a few things: (1) a model (likelihood and priors), (2) the data, (3) the parameters you want to make inference about, (4) initial values and (5) MCMC details (number of chains, length of the burn-in period and number of iterations following burn-in). 

First things first, let's not forget to load the `nimble` package:
```{r}
library(nimble)
```

Now let's go back to our example on animal survival from the previous chapter. First step is to build our model by specifying the binomial likelihood and a uniform prior on survival probability $\theta$. We use the `nimbleCode()` function and write code within curly brackets:
```{r}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  survived ~ dbinom(theta, released)
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
})
```

You may check that the `model` R object contains our code:
```{r}
model
```

In the code above, `survived ~ dbinom(theta, released)` says that `survived` the number of successes or animals that have survived over winter is distributed as (that's the `~`) as a binomial with `released` trials and probability of success or survival `theta`. Then `theta ~ dunif(0, 1)` assigns a uniform between 0 and 1 as a prior distribution to the survival probability. This is all you need, a likelihood and priors for model parameters, NIMBLE knows the Bayes theorem. A few comments:    

+ All the distributions you need are available in NIMBLE^[Parallel w/ distributions in R? Forward ref to other distributions used in next chapters? Mention that you can write your own? Example below?].  

+ It does not matter in what order you write each line of code, NIMBLE uses what is called a declarative language for building models^[Introduce nodes and edges here, along w/ stochastic vs. deterministic nodes? A node (sometimes called a vertex) holds one value, which may be a scalar or a vector. Edges define the relationships between nodes. A huge variety of statistical models can be thought of as graphs. Each relation defines a node in the model. The node on the left of a relation is defined in terms of other nodes – referred to as parent nodes – that appear on the right hand side. Taken together, the nodes in the model form a directed acyclic graph (with the parent/child relationships represented as directed edges). The very top-level nodes in the graph, with no parents, are constant nodes, which are defined either in the model definition (e.g. 1.0E-3), or in the data when the model is compiled (e.g. x[1]). Relations can be of two types. A stochastic relation (~) defines a stochastic node, representing a random variable in the model. A deterministic relation (<-) defines a deterministic node, the value of which is determined exactly by the values of its parents.]. In brief, you write code that tells NIMBLE what you want to achieve, and not how to get there. In contrast an imperative programming language requires that you write what you want to happen step by step.  

+ `survived` and `released` are known data, only `theta` needs to be estimated.

Second step in our workflow is to read in some data^[Distinguish constants and data, see commented text]. We use a list in which we name every component that match the name of variables in model specification:
```{r}
my.data <- list(released = 57, survived = 19)
```

<!-- Distinguish constants and data. To Nimble, not all "data" is data... -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- my.constants <- list(released = 57) -->
<!-- my.data <- list(survived = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Constants**: -->
<!-- + Can never be changed -->
<!-- + Must be provided when a model is defined (part of the model structure) -->
<!-- + E.g. vector of known index values, variables used to define for-loops, etc. -->

<!-- After defining the model code, we should define the constants, initial values and data list. Compared to WinBUGS and JAGS, data and initial values can be defined in the same way, while ‘constants’ is a new list that contains the values that would not change, including the variables that define for-loop indices. In our settings, the lists of data, constants and initial values are given as follows: -->

<!-- **Data**: -->
<!-- + Can be changed without re-building the model -->
<!-- + Can be (re-)simulated within a model -->
<!-- + E.g. stuff that *only* appears to the left of a "~" -->

<!-- For computational efficiency, better to specify as much as possible as constants. NIMBLE will help you with this! -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model, -->
<!--                           data = my.data, -->
<!--                           constants = my.constants, -->
<!--                           inits = initial.values, -->
<!--                           monitors = parameters.to.save, -->
<!--                           niter = n.iter, -->
<!--                           nburnin = n.burnin, -->
<!--                           nchains = n.chains) -->
<!-- ``` -->

Third step is to tell NIMBLE which parameters in your model you would like to keep track of, in other words the parameters you are interested in. In our simple model there is a single parameter `theta` for survival so not much of a choice really, but it will obviously not be the case in general.
```{r}
parameters.to.save <- c("theta")
```

Fourth step is to specify initial values for all model parameters. To make sure that the MCMC algorithm explores the posterior distribution, we start different chains with different parameter values. You can specify initial values for each chain in a list and put them in yet another list:
```{r}
init1 <- list(theta = 0.1)
init2 <- list(theta = 0.5)
init3 <- list(theta = 0.9)
initial.values <- list(init1, init2, init3)
initial.values
```

Alternatively, you may write a simple R function that generates random initial values:
```{r}
initial.values <- function() list(theta = runif(1,0,1))
initial.values()
```

Firth and last step, you need to tell NIMBLE the number of chains to run `n.chain`, how long the burn-in period should be `n.burnin` and the number of iterations to be used for posterior inference, that is following the burn-in period. In NIMBLE, you specify the total number of iterations `n.iter`, so that the number of posterior samples per chain is `n.iter - n.burnin`^[To be smoothed: these are R objects, not nimbleMCMC() arguments; also thinning in the formula, but by default is 1 and we do not use it, so just ignore.].
```{r}
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 3
```

We now have all the ingredients to run model, that is to sample in the posterior distribution of model parameters using MCMC simulations. This is accomplished using function `nimbleMCMC()`: 
```{r, cache = TRUE}
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model,
                          data = my.data,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
```

NIMBLE goes through several steps that we will explain later on^[Say a few words on the messages we receive? Comment on arguments of the function? E.g. ProgressBar can be supressed if too depressing.]. 

## Making sense of the MCMC outputs

### Post-process MCMC outputs by hand

```{r}
str(mcmc.output)
```

```{r}
head(mcmc.output$chain1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcmc.output %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = chain1[,"theta"]), color = "white") +
  labs(x = "survival probability")
```

### Post-process MCMC outputs without pain

We use MCMCvis, but there are other perfectly valid options out there like ggmcmc and basicMCMCplots.

Numerical summaries.
```{r}
library(MCMCvis)
MCMCsummary(mcmc.output, round = 2)
```

Trace and posterior density

```{r}
MCMCtrace(mcmc.output,
          pdf = FALSE)
```

```{r}
MCMCtrace(mcmc.output,
          pdf = FALSE,
          ind = TRUE,
          Rhat = TRUE,
          n.eff = TRUE)
```

## 

Proposer le même modèle avec la bernoulli pour montrer une boucle, et la distinctions data vs. constantes. The binomial is just a sum of Bernoulli outcomes. Like flipping a coin for each individual and get a survivor with prob phi. Comme dans annexe Hobbs. Vectorize also. Et si possible deterministic node? Life expectancy with $1/\log(\theta)$?

```{r eval = FALSE}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:released){
    survived[i] ~ dbern(theta)
  }
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
})
my.data <- list(survived = c(rep(1,19), rep(0,57-19)))
my.constants <- list(released = 57)
parameters.to.save <- c("theta")
initial.values <- function() list(theta = runif(1,0,1))
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 3
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model,
                          data = my.data,
                          constants = my.constants,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
```

## Behind the hood

Our workflow so far.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nimble_workflow_sofar.png")
```

But `nimble` gives full access to the MCMC engine

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nimble_workflow.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/I1bIY06.gif")
```

You're exactly right, Keith - those options are not available when using nimbleMCMC. The nimbleMCMC interface is designed only for running the "default" MCMC, which involves no customization of the MCMC sampling algorithms themselves. If you want to delve deeper into customizing the MCMC sampling strategies, then you're right, the workflow to use is:

+ nimbleModel

+ configureMCMC

+ buildMCMC

+ compileNimble

+ runMCMC

I know this is more steps than a single call to nimbleMCMC, but the changes from using nimbleMCMC to the functional workflow above are quite mechanical. If more direction on how/where the various arguments to those functions should be organized, then just let me know - no problem at all.

Go through example again. Show how to debug. Move stuff from Speed here.

### Functions

Say we want an R function that adds 2 to every value in a vector.
```{r}
add2 <- function(x) {
   x + 2 
}
Radd2 <- nimbleRcall(function(x = double(0)){}, 
                     Rfun = 'add2',
                     returnType = double(0))
demoCode <- nimbleCode({
  mu ~ dnorm(0,1)
  for(i in 1:n) {
    x[i] ~ dnorm(mu, sd = 1)
    z[i] <- Radd2(x[i])
    } 
})

param_names <- c("mu", "z")
mcmc.out <- nimbleMCMC(code = demoCode, 
                      constants = list(n = 4),
                      data = list(x = c(-1, -2, 1, 2)), 
                      inits = list(mu = rnorm(1)),
                      monitors = param_names,
                      nchains = 2, 
                      niter = 1000,
                      nburnin = 500)
library(MCMCvis)
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.out, round = 2)
```

Change format to vectorise.
```{r}
add2 <- function(x) {
   x + 2 
}
Radd2 <- nimbleRcall(function(x = double(1)){}, 
                     Rfun = 'add2',
                     returnType = double(1))
demoCode <- nimbleCode({
  mu ~ dnorm(0,1)
  for(i in 1:n) {
    x[i] ~ dnorm(mu, sd = 1)
    }
    z[1:4] <- Radd2(x[1:4])
})

param_names <- c("mu", "z")
mcmc.out <- nimbleMCMC(code = demoCode, 
                      constants = list(n = 4),
                      data = list(x = c(-1, -2, 1, 2)), 
                      inits = list(mu = rnorm(1)),
                      monitors = param_names,
                      nchains = 2, 
                      niter = 1000,
                      nburnin = 500)
library(MCMCvis)
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.out, round = 2)
```

Now have paramater to estimate as parameter of your R function. 
```{r}
add2 <- function(x) {
   x + 2 
}
Radd2 <- nimbleRcall(function(x = double(0)){}, 
                     Rfun = 'add2',
                     returnType = double(0))
demoCode <- nimbleCode({
  mu ~ dnorm(0,1)
  for(i in 1:n) {x[i] ~ dnorm(mu, sd = 1)} 
  z <- Radd2(mu)
})

param_names <- c("mu", "z")
mcmc.out <- nimbleMCMC(code = demoCode, 
                      constants = list(n = 4),
                      data = list(x = c(-1, -2, 1, 2)), 
                      inits = list(mu = rnorm(1)),
                      monitors = param_names,
                      nchains = 2, 
                      niter = 1000,
                      nburnin = 500)
library(MCMCvis)
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.out, round = 2)
```

In general if you do need a nimbleRcall like this, there are a couple of considerations. It is common to need to write a wrapper function, i.e. a function you access via nimbleRcall that calls your actual function of interest with arguments and then return value rearranged as needed. For example, if you just need the eigenvectors, a wrapper function could pick those out and return them.  The bigger issue is the returnType declaration: nimble type declarations do not include an R list of type declarations as a nimble type.  I think you could use a nimbleList data structure for this purpose.  You would have to create a nimbleList type and then use that as the declared returnType.  But you would still need to write a wrapper, so that you could convert the list returned from base::eigen into a nimbleList object to return from your wrapper.  I hope that makes sense.

```{block2 fake, type='rmdnote', eval = FALSE}
The *hypothesis* is a working assumption about which you want to learn using *data*. In capture--recapture analyses, the hypothesis might be a parameter like detection probability, or regression parameters in a relationship between survival probability and a covariate. Bayes' theorem tells us how to obtain the probability of a hypothesis given the data we have.

In Stan you marginalise (ref forward to relevant section of the book), but difficult endeavour, and you do not need to do that with NIMBLE, it has algorithms that work fine with discrete latent states.  -->
