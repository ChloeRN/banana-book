# NIMBLE tutorial {#intronimble}

## Introduction

In this second chapter, you will get familiar with NIMBLE, an R package that implements up-to-date MCMC algorithms for fitting complex models. NIMBLE spares you from coding the MCMC algorithms by hand, and requires only the specification of a likelihood and priors for model parameters. We will illustrate NIMBLE main features with a simple example, but the ideas hold for other problems.  

## What is NIMBLE?

NIMBLE stands for **N**umerical **I**nference for statistical **M**odels using **B**ayesian and **L**ikelihood **E**stimation. Briefly speaking, NIMBLE is an R package that implements for you MCMC algorithms to generate samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters. Freed from the burden of coding your own MCMC algorithms, you only have to specify a likelihood and priors to apply the Bayes theorem. To do so, NIMBLE uses a syntax very similar to the R syntax, which should make your life easier. This so-called BUGS language is also used by other programs like WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, and JAGS. 

So why use NIMBLE you may ask? The short answer is that NIMBLE is capable of so much more! First, you will work from within R, but in the background NIMBLE will translate your code in C++ for (in general) faster computation. Second, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language for writing new functions and statistical distributions of your own, or borrow those written by others. Third, NIMBLE gives you full control of the MCMC samplers, and you may pick other algorithms than the defaults. Fourth, NIMBLE comes with a library of numerical methods other than MCMC algorithms, including sequential Monte Carlo (for particle filtering) and Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (for maximum likelihood). Last but not least, the development team is friendly and helpful, and based on users' feedbacks, NIMBLE folks work constantly at improving the package capabilities. 

## Running NIMBLE

### The basics

To run NIMBLE, you will need to:  
1. Build a model consisting of a likelihood and priors.   
2. Read in some data.   
3. Specify parameters you want to make inference about.   
4. Pick initial values for parameters to be estimated (for each chain).   
5. Provide MCMC details namely the number of chains, the length of the burn-in period and the number of iterations following burn-in.   

First things first, let's not forget to load the `nimble` package:
```{r}
library(nimble)
```

Now let's go back to our example on animal survival from the previous chapter. First step is to build our model by specifying the binomial likelihood and a uniform prior on survival probability $\theta$. We use the `nimbleCode()` function and write code within curly brackets:
```{r}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  survived ~ dbinom(theta, released)
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
})
```

You may check that the `model` R object contains your code:
```{r}
model
```

In the code above, `survived` and `released` are known data, only `theta` needs to be estimated. The line `survived ~ dbinom(theta, released)` says that the number of successes or animals that have survived over winter  `survived` is distributed as (that's the `~`) as a binomial with `released` trials and probability of success or survival `theta`. Then `theta ~ dunif(0, 1)` assigns a uniform between 0 and 1 as a prior distribution to the survival probability. This is all you need, a likelihood and priors for model parameters, NIMBLE knows the Bayes theorem. 

A few comments:    

+ Most usual distributions are available in NIMBLE. We will use later in the book `dbeta`, `dmultinom` and `dnorm` among others. If you cannot find what you need in NIMBLE, you can write your own distribution as illustrated in Section \@ref(write-your-own-distribution).

+ It does not matter in what order you write each line of code, NIMBLE uses what is called a declarative language for building models. In brief, you write code that tells NIMBLE what you want to achieve, and not how to get there. In contrast, an imperative language requires that you write what you want your program to do step by step.

+ **"Some terminology to introduce. A node (sometimes called a vertex) holds one value, which may be a scalar or a vector. Edges define the relationships between nodes. A huge variety of statistical models can be thought of as graphs. Each relation defines a node in the model." "The node on the left of a relation is defined in terms of other nodes – referred to as parent nodes – that appear on the right hand side. Taken together, the nodes in the model form a directed acyclic graph (with the parent/child relationships represented as directed edges). The very top-level nodes in the graph, with no parents, are constant nodes, which are defined either in the model definition (e.g. 1.0E-3), or in the data when the model is compiled (e.g. x[1])."** 

Second step in our workflow is to read in some data. We use a list in which each component corresponds to a known variable in the model:
```{r}
my.data <- list(released = 57, survived = 19)
```

Third step is to tell NIMBLE which parameters in your model you would like to keep track of, in other words the parameters you are interested in. In our simple model there is a single parameter `theta` for survival so you do not have much of a choice. However, in general, you will have several parameters, including some of no prime interest, and having the control on verbosity will prove handy.
```{r}
parameters.to.save <- c("theta")
```

Fourth step is to specify initial values for all model parameters. To make sure that the MCMC algorithm explores the posterior distribution, we start different chains with different parameter values. You can specify initial values for each chain in a list and put them in yet another list:
```{r}
init1 <- list(theta = 0.1)
init2 <- list(theta = 0.5)
init3 <- list(theta = 0.9)
initial.values <- list(init1, init2, init3)
initial.values
```

Alternatively, you may write a simple R function that generates random initial values:
```{r}
initial.values <- function() list(theta = runif(1,0,1))
initial.values()
```

Firth and last step, you need to tell NIMBLE the number of chains to run `n.chain`, how long the burn-in period should be `n.burnin` and the number of iterations to be used for posterior inference, that is following the burn-in period. In NIMBLE, you specify the total number of iterations `n.iter`, so that the number of posterior samples per chain is `n.iter - n.burnin`. **To be smoothed: these are R objects, not nimbleMCMC() arguments; also thinning in the formula, but by default is 1 and we do not use it, so just ignore.**
```{r}
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 3
```

We now have all the ingredients to run model, that is to sample in the posterior distribution of model parameters using MCMC simulations. This is accomplished using function `nimbleMCMC()`: 
```{r, cache = TRUE}
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model,
                          data = my.data,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
```

NIMBLE goes through several steps that we will explain later on. **Say a few words on the messages we receive. Comment on arguments of the function: E.g. ProgressBar can be supressed if too depressing.** 

```{block2 nimble_workflow, type='rmdnote', eval = FALSE}
Repeat workflow. Main steps. Likelihood and prior for parameters. 
```

### Into specifics

Ici on reprend le modèle simple du dessus, et on l'exprime un peu différemment pour illustrer qqs autres features de NIMBLE: i) loops, ii) distinction between constants and data, iii) stochastic vs deterministic nodes, and edges. The binomial is just a sum of Bernoulli outcomes. Like flipping a coin for each individual and get a survivor with prob theta. Here survived is a Bernoulli random variable taking value 1 if animal survived, and 0 otherwise. **Voir dans annexe Hobbs**. E.g. `survived[1] ~ dbern(theta)` up to `survived[59] ~ dbern(theta)`. Likelihood contribution of individuals. Loops is the product. Iid. Instead of duplicating the same line of code `survived[i] ~ dbern(theta)` we use a loop. 
```{r}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:released){
    survived[i] ~ dbern(theta)
  }
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
  life_expectancy <- -1/log(theta)
})
```

Note the `life_expectancy <- -1/log(theta)` which gives life expectancy. **Relations can be of two types. We have seen earlier a stochastic relation (`~`) that defines a stochastic node, representing a random variable in the model. A deterministic relation (`<-`) defines a deterministic node, the value of which is determined exactly by the values of its parents.**

<!-- Distinguish constants and data. To Nimble, not all "data" is data... -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- my.constants <- list(released = 57) -->
<!-- my.data <- list(survived = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Constants**: -->
<!-- + Can never be changed -->
<!-- + Must be provided when a model is defined (part of the model structure) -->
<!-- + E.g. vector of known index values, variables used to define for-loops, etc. -->

<!-- After defining the model code, we should define the constants, initial values and data list. Compared to WinBUGS and JAGS, data and initial values can be defined in the same way, while ‘constants’ is a new list that contains the values that would not change, including the variables that define for-loop indices. In our settings, the lists of data, constants and initial values are given as follows: -->

<!-- **Data**: -->
<!-- + Can be changed without re-building the model -->
<!-- + Can be (re-)simulated within a model -->
<!-- + E.g. stuff that *only* appears to the left of a "~" -->

<!-- For computational efficiency, better to specify as much as possible as constants. NIMBLE will help you with this! -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model, -->
<!--                           data = my.data, -->
<!--                           constants = my.constants, -->
<!--                           inits = initial.values, -->
<!--                           monitors = parameters.to.save, -->
<!--                           niter = n.iter, -->
<!--                           nburnin = n.burnin, -->
<!--                           nchains = n.chains) -->
<!-- ``` -->


```{r}
my.data <- list(survived = c(rep(1,19), rep(0,57-19)))
my.constants <- list(released = 57)
```

The rest is the same. Steps 3, 4 and 5. 
```{r}
parameters.to.save <- c("theta", "life_expectancy")
initial.values <- function() list(theta = runif(1,0,1))
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 3
```

Run model, add argument `constants = my.constants`.
```{r}
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model,
                          data = my.data,
                          constants = my.constants,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
```

Life expectancy directly monitored. But you can also calculate it outside NIMBLE by hand:
```{r}
theta <- c(mcmc.output$chain1[,'theta'], 
  mcmc.output$chain2[,'theta'],
  mcmc.output$chain3[,'theta'])
lambda <- -1/log(theta)
head(lambda)
```

Visualise:
```{r}
lambda %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = value), color = "white") +
  labs(x = "life expectancy")
```

## Making sense of the MCMC outputs

### Post-process MCMC outputs by hand

Inspect what's in there:
```{r}
str(mcmc.output)
```

```{r}
head(mcmc.output$chain1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mcmc.output %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = chain1[,"theta"]), color = "white") +
  labs(x = "survival probability")
```

### Post-process MCMC outputs without pain

We use MCMCvis, but there are other perfectly valid options out there like ggmcmc and basicMCMCplots.

<!-- Finally we want to look at our samples. NIMBLE returns samples as a simple matrix with named columns. There are numerous packages for processing MCMC output. If you want to use the coda package, you can convert a matrix to a coda mcmc object like this: -->

<!-- library(coda) -->
<!-- coda.samples <- as.mcmc(samples) -->

<!-- Alternatively, if you call nimbleMCMC with the argument samplesAsCodaMCMC = TRUE, the samples will be returned as a coda object. -->

<!-- To show that MCMC really happened, here is a plot of N.critical: -->

<!-- plot(jitter(samples[, "N.critical"]), xlab = "iteration", ylab = "N.critical", -->
<!--      main = "Number of populations with critical size", -->
<!--      type = "l") -->



Numerical summaries.
```{r}
library(MCMCvis)
MCMCsummary(mcmc.output, round = 2)
```

Trace and posterior density

```{r}
MCMCtrace(mcmc.output,
          pdf = FALSE,
          params = "theta")
```

```{r}
MCMCtrace(mcmc.output,
          pdf = FALSE,
          ind = TRUE,
          Rhat = TRUE,
          n.eff = TRUE,
          params = "theta")
```

## Advanced stuff

**Move material from Speed slides here. Say that this section can be skipped.**

### Vectorization
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# JAGS (& Nimble)
for(t in 1:Tmax){
  x[t] <- Mu.x + epsilon[t]
}

# Nimble
x[1:Tmax] <- Mu.x + epsilon[1:Tmax]
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  survived[1:released] ~ dbern(theta)
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
  life_expectancy <- -1/log(theta)
})
```


### Flexible specification of distributions
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# JAGS (& Nimble)
for(t in 1:Tmax){
  epsilon[t] ~ dnorm(0, tau)
}
tau <- pow(sigma, -2)
sigma ~ dunif(0, 5)

# Nimble
for(t in 1:Tmax){
  epsilon[t] ~ dnorm(0, sd = sigma)
}
sigma ~ dunif(0, 5)
```

+ Your own functions and distributions
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x[1:Tmax] <- myNimbleFunction(a = Mu.x, b = epsilon[1:Tmax])
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sigma ~ dCustomDistr(c = 0.5, z = 10)
```

+ The end of empty indices
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# JAGS
sum.x <- sum(x[])

# Nimble
sum.x <- sum(x[1:Tmax])
```

### Behind the hood

Our workflow so far.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nimble_workflow_sofar.png")
```

But `nimble` gives full access to the MCMC engine

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nimble_workflow.png")
```

The `nimbleMCMC()` interface runs the "default" MCMC, which precludes any customization of the MCMC sampling algorithms. This is fine for most use, but in some situations useful to know what's behind the hood. The workflow to use is: `nimbleModel()`, `configureMCMC()`, `buildMCMC()`, `compileNimble()` and `runMCMC()`. Why is it useful? **Go through example again. Show how to debug. Move stuff from Speed here.**

### Call R functions within NIMBLE

Say we want an R function that adds 2 to every value in a vector.
```{r}
calculate_life_expectancy <- function(x) {
   -1/log(x)
}
```

This function can be any function from R packages, easier to call with `name_package::my_function()`.

Now a wrapper. 
```{r}
Rcalculate_life_expectancy <- nimbleRcall(function(x = double(0)){}, 
                     Rfun = 'calculate_life_expectancy',
                     returnType = double(0))
```

**Explain format. double(0), double(1), double(2). Best advice is to have a look to other functions.**

```{r}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:released){
    survived[i] ~ dbern(theta)
  }
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
  life_expectancy <- Rcalculate_life_expectancy(theta)
})
```
Comment on the call to function `Rcalculate_life_expectancy()`.

Rest is unchanged.
```{r}
my.data <- list(survived = c(rep(1,19), rep(0,57-19)))
my.constants <- list(released = 57)
parameters.to.save <- c("theta", "life_expectancy")
initial.values <- function() list(theta = runif(1,0,1))
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 3
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model,
                          data = my.data,
                          constants = my.constants,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
```

Display outputs. 
```{r}
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.output, round = 2)
```

Helpful when object format unusual for NIMBLE, like spatial object. Global environment. **"In general if you do need a nimbleRcall like this, there are a couple of considerations. It is common to need to write a wrapper function, i.e. a function you access via nimbleRcall that calls your actual function of interest with arguments and then return value rearranged as needed. For example, if you just need the eigenvectors, a wrapper function could pick those out and return them.  The bigger issue is the returnType declaration: nimble type declarations do not include an R list of type declarations as a nimble type.  I think you could use a nimbleList data structure for this purpose.  You would have to create a nimbleList type and then use that as the declared returnType.  But you would still need to write a wrapper, so that you could convert the list returned from base::eigen into a nimbleList object to return from your wrapper.". See also https://kenkellner.com/blog/models-with-integrals.html.**

### Code your own sampler

```{r}
model <- nimbleCode({
  # likelihood
  for (i in 1:released){
    survived[i] ~ dbern(theta)
  }
  # prior
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
  life_expectancy <- Rcalculate_life_expectancy(theta)
})
my.data <- list(survived = c(rep(1,19), rep(0,57-19)))
my.constants <- list(released = 57)
parameters.to.save <- c("theta", "life_expectancy")
initial.values <- function() list(theta = runif(1,0,1))
n.iter <- 5000
n.burnin <- 1000
n.chains <- 3
mcmc.output <- nimbleMCMC(code = model,
                          data = my.data,
                          constants = my.constants,
                          inits = initial.values,
                          monitors = parameters.to.save,
                          niter = n.iter,
                          nburnin = n.burnin,
                          nchains = n.chains)
MCMCsummary(object = mcmc.output, round = 2)
```

Your own Metropolis. **Introduce nimbleFunction earlier https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-user-defined.html#sec:user-functions**
```{r}
my_metropolis <- nimbleFunction(
  name = 'my_metropolis',
  contains = sampler_BASE,
  setup = function(model, mvSaved, target, control) {
    calcNodes <- model$getDependencies(target)
    scale <- control$scale
  },
  run = function() {
    initialLP <- model$getLogProb(calcNodes)
    current <- model[[target]]
    lcurrent <- log(current / (1 - current))
    lproposal <- lcurrent  + rnorm(1, 0, scale)
    proposal <- plogis(lproposal)
    model[[target]] <<- proposal
    proposalLP <- model$calculate(calcNodes)
    lMHR <- proposalLP - initialLP
    if(runif(1,0,1) < exp(lMHR)) {
      ## accept
      copy(from = model, to = mvSaved, nodes = calcNodes, logProb = TRUE, row = 1)
    } else {
      ## reject
      copy(from = mvSaved, to = model, nodes = calcNodes, logProb = TRUE, row = 1)
    }
  },
  methods = list(
    reset = function() {}
  )
)
```

Parameter to tune. Seek equivalent in previous chapter.
```{r}
scale <- 0.05
```

Detailed workflow.
```{r}
Rmodel <- nimbleModel(model, my.constants, my.data, initial.values())
conf <- configureMCMC(Rmodel, monitors = c('theta'))
conf$printSamplers()
conf$printSamplers(byType = TRUE)
conf$removeSamplers(c('theta'))
conf$addSampler(target = 'theta', type = 'my_metropolis', control = list(scale = scale))
conf$printSamplers()
conf$printMonitors()
Rmcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
out <- compileNimble(list(model = Rmodel, mcmc = Rmcmc))
Cmcmc <- out$mcmc
samples <- runMCMC(Cmcmc, niter = 5000, nburnin = 1000)
samplesSummary(samples)
library(basicMCMCplots)
chainsPlot(samples)
```

Change parameter to tune.
```{r}
scale <- 2
Rmodel <- nimbleModel(model, my.constants, my.data, initial.values())
conf <- configureMCMC(Rmodel, monitors = c('theta'))
conf$printSamplers()
conf$printSamplers(byType = TRUE)
conf$removeSamplers(c('theta'))
conf$addSampler(target = 'theta', type = 'my_metropolis', control = list(scale = scale))
conf$printSamplers()
conf$printMonitors()
Rmcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)
out <- compileNimble(list(model = Rmodel, mcmc = Rmcmc))
Cmcmc <- out$mcmc
samples <- runMCMC(Cmcmc, niter = 5000, nburnin = 1000)
samplesSummary(samples)
chainsPlot(samples)
```

<!-- ## A dire quelque part? -->

<!-- Pourquoi Nimble plutôt que Stan? Syntaxe BUGS, also discrete latent states easier to deal with, no need to marginalise. In Stan you marginalise (ref forward to relevant section of the book), but difficult endeavour, and you do not need to do that with NIMBLE, it has algorithms that work fine with discrete latent states.  -->
