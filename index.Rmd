The HMM framework has gained much attention in the ecological literature over the last decade, and has been suggested as a general modelling framework for the demography of plant and animal populations. In particular, HMMs are increasingly used to analyse capture-recapture data and estimate key population parameters (e.g., survival, dispersal, recruitment or abundance) with applications all fields of ecology. In parallel, Bayesian statistics is relatively well established and fast growing in ecology and related disciplines, because it resonates with scientific reasoning and allows accommodating uncertainty smoothly. The popularity of Bayesian statistics also comes from the availability of free pieces of software (WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS, Stan, nimble) that allow practitioners to code their own analyses.

However, to my knowledge, a full Bayesian treatment of HMMs applied to capture-recapture data is yet to be proposed in a book. This is what I propose with this book. Besides, the popular software solutions come with computational limitations when ecologists have to deal with complex models and/or big data. I will use Nimble that is seen by many as the future of ecological data modelling because it extends the BUGS language for writing new functions and distributions, and provides samplers that can deal with discrete latent states in contrast with Stan. 

In this book, I will cover both the theory of HMMs for capture-recapture data, and the applications of these models to empower practitioners to fit their models with confidence. An important part of the book will consist in case studies presented in a tutorial style to abide by the “learning by doing” philosophy.

## Why read this book {-}


## Structure of the book {-}

Blabla. 

<!-- Chapters \@ref(introduction) and \@ref(components) introduce the basic usage and syntax, which should be sufficient to get most readers started in writing a book. Chapters \@ref(output-formats) and \@ref(customization) are for those who want to fine-tune the appearance of their books. They may look very technical if you are not familiar with HTML/CSS and LaTeX. You do not need to read these two chapters very carefully for the first time. You can learn what can be possibly changed, and come back later to know how. For Chapter \@ref(editing), the technical details are not important unless you do not use the RStudio IDE (Section \@ref(rstudio-ide)). Similarly, you may feel overwhelmed by the commands presented in Chapter \@ref(publishing) to publish your book, but again, we have tried to make it easy to publish your book online via the RStudio IDE. The custom commands and functions are only for those who choose not to use RStudio's service or want to understand the technical details. -->

## Software information and conventions {-}

This book uses primarily the R package **nimble**, so you need to at least install R and the **nimble** package. 

The R session information when compiling this book is shown below:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

We do not add prompts (`>` and `+`) to R source code in this book, and we comment out the text output with two hashes `##` by default, as you can see from the R session information above. This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code (the text output will be ignored since it is commented out). Package names are in bold text (e.g., **nimble**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `nimble::nimbleCode()`). The double-colon operator `::` means accessing an object from a package.
