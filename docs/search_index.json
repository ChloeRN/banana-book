[["index.html", "Bayesian Analysis of Capture-Recapture Data with Hidden Markov Models – Theory and Case Studies in R Preface", " Bayesian Analysis of Capture-Recapture Data with Hidden Markov Models – Theory and Case Studies in R Olivier Gimenez 2021-06-08 Preface The HMM framework has gained much attention in the ecological literature over the last decade, and has been suggested as a general modelling framework for the demography of plant and animal populations. In particular, HMMs are increasingly used to analyse capture-recapture data and estimate key population parameters (e.g., survival, dispersal, recruitment or abundance) with applications all fields of ecology. In parallel, Bayesian statistics is relatively well established and fast growing in ecology and related disciplines, because it resonates with scientific reasoning and allows accommodating uncertainty smoothly. The popularity of Bayesian statistics also comes from the availability of free pieces of software (WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS, Stan, nimble) that allow practitioners to code their own analyses. However, to my knowledge, a full Bayesian treatment of HMMs applied to capture-recapture data is yet to be proposed in a book. This is what I propose with this book. Besides, the popular software solutions come with computational limitations when ecologists have to deal with complex models and/or big data. I will use Nimble that is seen by many as the future of ecological data modelling because it extends the BUGS language for writing new functions and distributions, and provides samplers that can deal with discrete latent states in contrast with Stan. In this book, I will cover both the theory of HMMs for capture-recapture data, and the applications of these models to empower practitioners to fit their models with confidence. An important part of the book will consist in case studies presented in a tutorial style to abide by the “learning by doing” philosophy.

This is for your convenience when you want to copy and run the code (the text output will be ignored since it is commented out). Package names are in bold text (e.g., nimble), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')).

J’ai écrit des articles scientifiques faisant appel à la statistique bayésienne, et co-écrit avec des collègues britanniques un livre sur les analyses bayésiennes pour l’écologie des populations.

Yes, there is only one question here. Personally I do not like FAQs. They often mean surprises, and surprises are not good for software users. Q: Will bookdown have the features X, Y, and Z? A: The short answer is no, but if you have asked yourself three times “do I really need them” and the answer is still “yes”, please feel free to file a feature request to https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues. Users asking for more features often come from the LaTeX world. If that is the case for you, the answer to this question is yes, because Pandoc’s Markdown supports raw LaTeX code. Whenever you feel Markdown cannot do the job for you, you always have the option to apply some raw LaTeX code in your Markdown document. For example, you can create glossaries using the glossaries package, or embed a complicated LaTeX table, as long as you know the LaTeX syntax. However, please keep in mind that the LaTeX content is not portable. It will only work for LaTeX/PDF output, and will be ignored in other types of output. Depending on the request, we may port a few more LaTeX features into bookdown in the future, but our general philosophy is that Markdown should be kept as simple as possible. The most challenging thing in the world is not to learn fancy technologies, but control your own wild heart. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
